This is a little program for zooming parts of your desktop, very 
similar to xmag. The difference is, that it continously updates
it's contents.
There are two modes available. In mode one it follows the mouse
and displays everything whats under it. This is the default mode.
In the other mode it displays a static area. You can enter this
mode by clicking into the display window and dragging the appearing
rectangle to the desired region. You stop/return to mode one by
pressing the right mouse button.
If you have a display with different visuals and want to zoom
an area in a window not laying in the default visual, you will
find the "jump" option very handy. Just press the button and
click on the appropriate window.
Please feel free to change the Imakefile if you want a Motif-
or Lesstif version instead of the default Xaw one.
